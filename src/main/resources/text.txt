Solomon (/ˈsɒləmən/),[a] also called Jedidiah,[b] was the fourth monarch of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, according to the Hebrew Bible.[4][5] The successor of his father David, he is described as having been the penultimate ruler of all Twelve Tribes of Israel under an amalgamated Israel and Judah. The hypothesized dates of Solomon's reign are from 970 to 931 BCE. According to the biblical narrative, after Solomon's death, his son and successor Rehoboam adopted harsh policies towards the northern Israelites, who then rejected the reign of the House of David and sought Jeroboam as their king. In the aftermath of Jeroboam's Revolt, the Israelites were split between the Kingdom of Israel in the north (Samaria) and the Kingdom of Judah in the south (Judea); the Bible depicts Rehoboam and the rest of Solomon's patrilineal descendants ruling over independent Judah alone.[6]

A Jewish prophet, Solomon is portrayed as wealthy, wise, powerful, and a dedicated follower of Yahweh (God),[7] as attested by the eponymous Solomon's Temple,[8][9] which was the first Temple in Jerusalem.[5] He is also the subject of many later references and legends, most notably in the Testament of Solomon, part of biblical apocrypha from the 1st century CE.

The historicity of Solomon is the subject of significant debate. Current scholarly consensus allows for a historical Solomon but regards his reign as king over Israel and Judah in the 10th century BCE as uncertain and the biblical portrayal of his apparent empire's opulence as most probably an anachronistic exaggeration.[10][11][12][13]

Solomon is also revered in Christianity and Islam. In the New Testament, he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom, suitable for rhetorical comparison to Jesus,[14][15] suitable for a rhetorical figure heightening God's generosity.[16][17] In the Quran, he is considered to be a major Islamic prophet. In primarily non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.[18]
